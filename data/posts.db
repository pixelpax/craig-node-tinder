I have not been waiting for things to fail. Please see the maintenance items completed and scheduled. \n\nOnly reason for sale is due to crossing paths with a unique 2005 Sprinter 3500 Box Truck which I acquired while helping a friend source a Sprinter. He got another 2004 Sprinter and there's a conversion underway on the box truck.\n\nAlways registered in California\n\nDrive it to Baja and not worry about the diesel fuel which all 2007 and newer diesel engines need to worry about south of the boarder.\n\nConversion completed in partnership with a custom boat builder. Highlights include: \n\n+ Complete separation of  mud room/'garage' from living area. ability to tuck away two 29\" mtn bikes plus much much more in garage\n+ Plenty of living and garage storage\n+ Open standing living space with the ability to sit on counters and swivel seats.\n+ Marine grade wiring and electronics\n+ High quality insulation with maximum r-value, water vapor, weight, sound dampening in mind\n+ A unique and road-tested heating system which simultaneously heats the engine and cabin area with the engine off or on. Diesel fired heater plumbed to diesel tank. Can be turned on via clock, thermostat, or vehicle key fob. Wired to house battery bank when engine is off and to vehicle battery when engine is on.\n+ Indoor outdoor living and cooking\n+ Security\n+ Utility - just as suited to go to the hardware store/plant nursery/drop the kids off at school as it is to head to far reaches of British Columbia and beyond.\n\nComponents/items/functions worthy to note:\n\n+ *Tucked away full length fly rod/reel fishing cabinet (4 rods x9.5'). *Only calling out 1st because the remainder of the build carried this amount of thoughtfulness\n+ Espar D5 Hydronic heater/furnace\n+ Espar 7 Day Timer\n+ Thermostat to activate heater\n+ Agile Offroad custom tuned Fox Shocks in rear and Koni adjustable struts installed on front. Installed @ 195K miles, like I said, I had no intention of selling this vehicle just a couple thousand miles ago.\n+ 300 watts of solar (2x150 watt panels) with 1 panel which can tilt for 30% solar efficiency increase \n+ 4 x 225amp hour Trojan 105 6v batteries for 500 amp hours\n+ Blue Sea ML Automatic Charging Relay (The one you can combine manually or via switch to charge your starter battery in the event starter batt dies)\n+ Blue Sea MC 1830 State of Charge (SOC) battery bank monitor.\n+ Flip-down table; very stable (I can sit on it @ 190lbs)\n+ Driver/Passenger swivel seats\n+ 2 person rear passenger seat. Easy to take in and out. Acts as a great 'couch' when camped or at your favorite festival. Seat was harvested from a 1994 VW Westfalia\n+ Brush guard/deer smasher up front - Custom fabricated from tubular steel. Upol bed liner coated.\n+ Green Diesel Engineering (GDE) engine tune. Increases horse power, torque, and fuel economy.\n+ Hood, front side panels, and roof were coated with matching Arctic White (OEM paint color) UPOL Truck bed liner. Applied to combat rock chips on the open snow roads a couple years ago. This is the best-of-the-best bed liner product. After two years since it was put on it still looks great.\n+ 3 speed 'Fantastic Fan'\n+ Insulation - Front: Factory from MBZ in Germany. Cabin Ceiling: Nashua Foil, 2\" R-Tek Closed Foam, 2 x1/4\" Poplar ply wood. Cabin Walls: Nashua Foil, 6\" bagged-Fiber Glass, Carpet over 1/4\" Fiberboard.

My answer was no, which is why I went this route.\n+ Spice Rack\n+ Upgraded Kenwood stereo with 4\" Polk speakers up front and Helix 6\"x9\" for the back\n+ Cut out in cabinet for fridge (you can order your own fancy fridge for this spot). I ended up putting a garbage can there (fits perfect) and bought a Dometic cooler fridge which could be moved around and even outside so folks wouldn't be going in and out to get their beer. \n+ Queen size 4\" memory foam mattress. Very comfortable. Freshly cleaned. Freshly cleaned.\n+ Tow hitch\n+ DC to AC Inverter which can power most electronics and even a vacuum cleaner. It's not sign wave... See 'not excellent/perfect'\n+ 22 average mpg with a moderate load.\n\nReplaced Items and Maintenance Items/Schedule (all fluids and equipment are Mercedes approved, or Mercedes, OEM provider, no Chinese junk):\n\n+ Oil fluid and filter changes performed in 10K intervals. Next due: 200K. Always on time. No BS.\n+ Fuel filter changed at every 20K miles. Next due at 210K. see above.\n+ @ 185K miles I replaced the serpentine belt, viscous fan clutch, belt tensioner, radiator, engine water pump, thermostat, a few hoses.  This is an investment in maintenance to ensure engine health. Belt, belt tensioner, pulleys should be replaced next @ 215K.\n+ @ ~ 190k i had black smoke spewing out the exhaust. Replaced all injectors with remanufactured bosch (all om647 bosh injectors are remanufactured with critical new parts as they don't make them 'new'  off the line any longer) which fixed the smoke with new seals and hold-down bolts. Reamed bottom of bores. The useful life of most Bosch CDI injectors is ~185k miles (according to injector experts). My fuel economy went from 19mpg to 23 mpg over night. This is a $3K+ service.\n+ @ 192 k I develop a howling noise coming from the rear end. It was a failed pinion bearing. I replaced the entire axle with rear differential. Wheel bearings, everything. $2.5K job. 25K mile warranty.\n+ Auxiliary water pump (different from internal engine water pump) was replaced at 180K. These tend to go out about every 40k miles or so and is needed for the Espar Hydronic heater to run properly. This should be on your maintenance schedule.\n+ Air intake filter was replaced at 187K and I've been cleaning it every oil change. It's due for a change.\n+ Glow plugs were just changed out at 195K. Only two were failing but I went ahead and replaced all of them. \n+ New solid state glow plug module. The original on all 2004 - 2006 Sprinters are defective and will eventually fail if it hasn't already.\n+ Front brakes and e-brake were replaced ~ 192K and rear were replaced @ ~185K. E-brake replaced with Sprinter 3500 caliper. The 3500 caliper gives amazing braking power. Go test a regular 2500 and then test mine. Huge difference. The REAR brakes are good at the moment, but they will be next.\n+ Cabin air filter. I changed it out a couple summers ago and it seems fine. Probably due after this coming summer 2018.\n+ Transmission fluid @ 192k, next due at ~ 245K\n+ Starter Battery replaced at ~ 195K\n+ Aluminum Turbo Resonator\n+ Down stream air charge hose was replaced @ 195K (I was getting a charge air pressure loss code and changed it out even though the failure was a simple slipped hose (caused air pressure loss).)\n\nNot great/excellent:\n\n+ The body and paint are in good shape but not excellent/perfect.\n+ I put my Xantrex inverter into my new conversion. The inverter coming with the van is functional but doesn't match the quality of the other components. If you're running a water boiler you will need to upgrade.\n+ In utilizing the SOC monitor I've kept the batteries in great shape. They still peak out at 14.4Xv and settle down to 13.3. But, they are three seasons old. They should last a couple more seasons at least.\n+ The interior is in good shape but as stated above.. used. therefore there are nicks, rubs, scratches here and there.\n+ Many moons ago I put on the trailer hitch and wired in a trailer harness plug. I had problems with my blinkers due to the trailer harness so I took it out given I wasn't ever towing anything.\n\nTHIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN MY BABY SINCE 2012 (OVER 13OK MILES) AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY INTENTION OF SELLING IT. IT'S SOLID! I WANTED TO DRIVE IT UNTIL THE WEELS FLEW OFF ON THE WAY TO LOST TRAIL POWDER MOUNTAIN MT @ 1 MILLION MILES ON MY 85TH BIRTHDAY!\n\nThanks for looking and wading through all this information. I know it's been a little long-winded. Details are important in a purchase like this. Please go look at a few other 2004 - 2006 T1N Custom Converted Sprinters before coming to see mine so you have a feel for the market. Lock/unlock and open all the doors, roll down the windows, turn on the AC and ventilation system, do all the settings on the control panel work?, etc. I look forward to meeting you.\n\nI don't need help selling it. I won't reply to emails fishing for information; I've spent a lot of time putting all relevant information into this ad. Sure, send me an email if you'd like, but I'd prefer hopping on the phone to schedule a showing and then answer questions in person. Come and check it out!! It's 75% the rig other's are charging over $100K @ less than 1/3 the price. No, I'm not interested in any trades.","mapUrl":"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@37.905300,-122.054900,16z","pid":"6560288009","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/sfo/cto/6560288009","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"sfbay.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/sfo/cto/6560288009"},"title":"2004 Mercedes/Dodge 2500 Sprinter 140 High Roof Camper Conversion","url":"https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/cto/d/2004-mercedes-dodge-2500/6560288009.html","postedAt":{"$$date":1523649356000},"updatedAt":{"$$date":1524145665000},"images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_8sFCyRK5nby_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_522tZIIB1Yw_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_hSa9NbsI4OW_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00707_3Ah8goTJz13_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_fjNTnL5j0Mw_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_33gbfKyWwmI_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_fGBnndpPeBD_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_fTONTpMgdd5_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_fqTF72RLbsZ_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_dERMqm92V32_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00404_lLKfO0ffbwd_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_4DYavE6QFYE_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00909_6DvXQHMP9WF_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01616_7xRVzcMeGwB_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01313_ga8ztYzzDK4_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_hoUu3RXd78N_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00000_1DLkr8ZN1G_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_c68xCux3gmf_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01212_hUI0xaK0TI1_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_9WnmlPGWdMk_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_9DYITBEvewt_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00101_68Bq5hDVMsF_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_3BVQ7Uef8A_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_kGFkCKqSK3S_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{"condition":"excellent","cylinders":"5 cylinders","fuel":"diesel","odometer":"197","paint_color":"white","title_status":"clean","transmission":"automatic"}}}

The staff at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South is committed to serving you, our friends and customers and we look forward to earning your business. For this reason, when dealing with Rick's Auto Marketing Center South you can be assured that your experience will be pressure free and that your satisfaction will be guaranteed.\n\nAutomotive Experience\nRichard Yow, of Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, opened his flagship dealership approximately 27 years ago in Carthage, North Carolina. Since this time, Richard has expanded his business nationwide by having a transparent business structure which has effectively built and continues to build customer loyalty. Proof of continued business excellence is evidenced by his flawless record with the Better Business Bureau, his reputation in the industry for ethical leadership and statewide recognition as a small business leader (as seen in North Carolina Small Business of the Year). Following present day operations at the North Carolina dealership, Richard vows to utilize the same practices and procedures at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South.\n\nWhat Do We Sell?\nThe automobiles being offered for sale at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South are prior corporate fleet lease automobiles and not prior rental or auction units.\n\nHow do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South?\nAs a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups. Furthermore, most of the off-lease automobiles offered for sale have only been assigned to and driven by one driver / owner before arriving on our lot.\n\nWhat Sets Us Apart From the Others?\nFrom the moment you walk in the door, our friendly and relaxed staff will lead you through the buying process without the high pressure you find at other dealerships. At Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, we believe in clear no haggle pricing and aren't afraid to clearly list the purchase price on each automobile.\n\nWe are ready to serve you.

It was sold as a 10 passenger van but currently set up as a 6 passenger van with large private sleeping area in the rear.  I have all the original seats and bought an extra matching 2 person back bench seat from another transit van allowing for multiple seating configurations, it's currently set up with two  2 person seats facing each other with a removable RV table in between.  All the original seat mounts were utilized and no structural modifications were required.  The bed frames were custom made with high grade knotless pine, it is light weight and was designed for easy removal, install and legs fold up for storage and adjustable height.  I am included 2 brand new unopened cot mattresses 4\" x 30\" x 75\" that fit perfectly.  The two part bed allows for multiple sleeping and storage configurations. The back area is completely private with  blackout window panels held in place by existing unaltered trim.  There is also a blackout curtain between bed area and seating area that is easily removable.  Has brand new (factory option) Hankook tires.  Also has heavy duty professionally mounted commercial roof rack and towing package installed.  I am also including a $450 Yeti 75 cooler that can be strapped in for convenience when traveling or camping. Oil change just completed and all service is current.  Body is in excellent shape and it drives like new. This is a must for someone looking for a turnkey camping van or the ultimate configurable road trip vehicle.","mapUrl":"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@38.216773,-122.128701,16z","pid":"6557821853","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/sfo/cto/6557821853","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"sfbay.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/sfo/cto/6557821853"},"title":"2015 Ford Transit 150 XLT / customized","url":"https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/cto/d/2015-ford-transit-150-wagon/6557821853.html","postedAt":{"$$date":1523435183000},"updatedAt":{"$$date":1524110764000},"images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00303_91k2LnpYm7Q_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_4jZz0fJs0fn_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_illt2FzgrHd_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01010_ioGr8lsZngB_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_1yuM96wZCHt_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_ZwMAp0Cr0L_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_j7BrfkXZScx_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_go6z2VTBvXP_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00202_fFIb63YooHD_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_6q33wK13IsD_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00404_fvxaLfu8Jtw_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_fp6EBp1J3S6_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01111_a0pHW20zg1g_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_71o8yAh7ZvW_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00202_1PSBmAFgqzP_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_dTxi0cmQlsd_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00303_1GSyENdWetQ_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_9CBKqj4dYR_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_1FSJxck6tE1_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01414_jyYHDV635Hu_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_WvV1lT89s9_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{"VIN":"1FMZK1YM2FKB13634","condition":"excellent","cylinders":"6 cylinders","drive":"rwd","fuel":"gas","odometer":"46000","paint_color":"silver","size":"full-size","title_status":"clean","transmission":"automatic","type":"van"}}}

The staff at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South is committed to serving you, our friends and customers and we look forward to earning your business. For this reason, when dealing with Rick's Auto Marketing Center South you can be assured that your experience will be pressure free and that your satisfaction will be guaranteed.\n\nAutomotive Experience\nRichard Yow, of Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, opened his flagship dealership approximately 27 years ago in Carthage, North Carolina. Since this time, Richard has expanded his business nationwide by having a transparent business structure which has effectively built and continues to build customer loyalty. Proof of continued business excellence is evidenced by his flawless record with the Better Business Bureau, his reputation in the industry for ethical leadership and statewide recognition as a small business leader (as seen in North Carolina Small Business of the Year). Following present day operations at the North Carolina dealership, Richard vows to utilize the same practices and procedures at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South.\n\nWhat Do We Sell?\nThe automobiles being offered for sale at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South are prior corporate fleet lease automobiles and not prior rental or auction units.\n\nHow do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South?\nAs a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups. Furthermore, most of the off-lease automobiles offered for sale have only been assigned to and driven by one driver / owner before arriving on our lot.\n\nWhat Sets Us Apart From the Others?\nFrom the moment you walk in the door, our friendly and relaxed staff will lead you through the buying process without the high pressure you find at other dealerships. At Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, we believe in clear no haggle pricing and aren't afraid to clearly list the purchase price on each automobile.\n\nWe are ready to serve you. Feel free to contact us with any comments or questions you may have.\n\n\n\nRick's Auto Marketing Center South\n1207 N Dixie Freeway \nNew Smyrna Beach, FL 32168\n\n\n\n\n\nCall NOW to Reserve this Freightliner_ Sprinter_! 386-259-3415\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Freightliner* *Sprinter* *2500 High Roof 170-in.

I bought it about a year ago for my construction business that I'm no longer running. I am only the second owner, previously was owned by the Seattle blood bank. Has high miles but is runs great and is in great condition. This has the 3.0 liter Mercedes Diesel engine, dual real wheels giving it a 5000lb payload capacity, high roof with the shorter wheelbase. Comes with 2 key fobs, 4 new rear tires, and a clean title in hand. \n\nThere is a smallish crack in the windshield, so eventually that will need to be replaced.

The staff at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South is committed to serving you, our friends and customers and we look forward to earning your business. For this reason, when dealing with Rick's Auto Marketing Center South you can be assured that your experience will be pressure free and that your satisfaction will be guaranteed.\n\nAutomotive Experience\nRichard Yow, of Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, opened his flagship dealership approximately 27 years ago in Carthage, North Carolina. Since this time, Richard has expanded his business nationwide by having a transparent business structure which has effectively built and continues to build customer loyalty. Proof of continued business excellence is evidenced by his flawless record with the Better Business Bureau, his reputation in the industry for ethical leadership and statewide recognition as a small business leader (as seen in North Carolina Small Business of the Year). Following present day operations at the North Carolina dealership, Richard vows to utilize the same practices and procedures at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South.\n\nWhat Do We Sell?\nThe automobiles being offered for sale at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South are prior corporate fleet lease automobiles and not prior rental or auction units.\n\nHow do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South?\nAs a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups. Furthermore, most of the off-lease automobiles offered for sale have only been assigned to and driven by one driver / owner before arriving on our lot.\n\nWhat Sets Us Apart From the Others?\nFrom the moment you walk in the door, our friendly and relaxed staff will lead you through the buying process without the high pressure you find at other dealerships. At Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, we believe in clear no haggle pricing and aren't afraid to clearly list the purchase price on each automobile.\n\nWe are ready to serve you.

I had it at Sportsmobile last week and they said this was the target price for this vehicle. Ours was commissioned to be done by Sportsmobile to the brand new vehicle in 2007. I bought it from the original owner, who was a BMW motorcycle mechanic and took great care of it. It had 63,000 on it when I bought it. I have been diligent about it's upkeep(changing fluids, fuel filters etc., including frequent tranny fluid changes) as well so this is one sweet vehicle. Because of the way both he and I drove it almost all mileage is highway mileage cruising at about 70mph. I lived in it for nearly two years, ranging from Alaska to Central America. If you want to go to Mexico our Central America, this is the newest year you want to have because it can handle high sulfur diesel. 2007 and new can not. This also has no wrecks other than someone hit the driver side door(nothing major and immediately fixed), clean title. \n\nTires were changed less than 15k miles ago\nFront brakes changed under 10k miles ago\nAll Shocks and rearbrakes were changed under 6000 miles ago\nSumo Springs added to the front under 6000 miles ago\n\nFeatures of the original van are pictured in the photo. Additions from the build are as follows: \n\nPerformance features added:\nPerformance tuner chip for engine (gets 20-22mpg with great power for an I-5 engine)\nAdjustable air ride system in rear\nAFE cleanable/hi flow air filter\nSUMO Springs in front(added last year with new shocks and makes a huge handling difference. I love them) \n\n\"House\" build items:\nMarine shower and toilet in own compartment with 6 gallon black water tank and 12 gallon grey water tank\nLPG Water Heater\nUnder van LPG tank \n20 Gallon Fresh Water tank\nNorcold 7.6 cu foot, electrical fridge/freezer with separate compartments\n150 watt alternator\n130 Kyocera Solar Panel (we also added a second Renogy100 watt panel with titling hardware last year)\n4D Agm \"house\" battery\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThese items were recommended by 3 electrical engineers that live off grid on solar and have made the biggest difference in our solar system, which is important with the fridge:\nNew(last year with panel addition) Boggart Engineering Trimetric 2030-RV house battery monitor center\nNew Boggart Engineering SC-2030 Solar charger\nChanged wiring from #10 to #6 for near zero voltage drop\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrip-lite 2000 watt inverter/ charger with shore power hook up\nLPG Stove in galley\nKitchen sink with extending faucet\nAttic Fan\nA/C unit for house\nSwivel front drive and passenger seat\nUnder seat safe\nFaimma Outdoor Awning\nCD Stereo with Ipod hookup\nSliding door windows\nRear sliding windows\nDual day/night window shades all around\nWindow privacy curtains for front\nMarine vinyl flooring \nVelcro bug nets for rear doors and slider(cost of around $900 from Sportsmobile or other manufacturers)\nRear ladder\nRoof rack\nExterior 110 outlets\nExterior lights\nIndoor lights\nLP detector\nCOs detector\nSmoke detector\nObviously, lots of storage cabinets etc.\nTV mount: see below about tv\nWe even have the original build book with all the manuals etc.\n\nNote:\nYou may notice the color of the couches/bed cabinets are wood. That is because last year, I took out the original particle board ones, replaced with maple(lighter, stiffer) raised them eight inches and slotted in surfboard slots to hide 3 surfboards inside. You could also hide ski's, snowboards, fishing poles etc. \n\nThere are also some cabinet faces that we had a little water spills with or spilled water and the particle board cabinet sucked up some water and some warped a bit at the bottm. This $52,000 price includes putting in new ones and slightly customizing them to your specs if you like. In that $52k price, we can also take out the A/C unit, which is basically unusable because it blows so hard right in your face, (we also never needed or used it)add in a second attic fan in it's place(cooling for you in bed) and add a third solar panel in it's place Or you can take it, as is for $48,000!

I had always wanted a Sportsmobile, but with more versatility. Able to quickly convert from a cargo hauler for the weekdays, to a camper for the weekends. So I built one. It's been a great camper, so but I no longer need it.\n\nThis van started as a 144\" Low Roof Cargo model, with a Turbocharged V6 Diesel engine, and airbags. The engine has power to spare and cruises like a dream. It's been up and down the coast a few times and mostly used for road trips. The 'contractor white' paint job is very discreet and great for stealth camping. \n\nIt has a very versatile interior, with a thin cabinet against the driver side wall and twin bunks that fold up out of the way for loading tall cargo, like bicycles or motorcycles. The bunks can be repositioned to any height along their vertical tracks, and made into a single queen size as well. The red bins in the photos come with the van, as they work well for additional bed supports. \n\nThere are two reclining seats from a Toyota Sienna in the second row. They are easily removable, and can be relocated fore/aft on the floor tracks.\n\nThe front seats have swivels, to rotate around towards the interior. I've installed two exterior backup cameras, one above and one below, which are both viewed on a storable monitor.\n\nThe van has been insulated well, with Thinsulate SM600 and E-Foil in the walls and ceiling. The floor has a layer of EVA foam insulation under it. I've installed L-track in the floor, for securing loads, and a simple removable rubber floor matt over that. \n\nThe sliding door has a CRL T-Vent window, and the drivers side wall opposite has an Egress window, which hinges out completely. I have purchased additional windows for the rear doors, but I never installed them, as I preferred the privacy. I can have them installed if you like.\n\n$38,000.00\n\n2014 Mercedes Crew Sprinter Rear Wheel Drive (2WD)\nV-6 Diesel 2500 Blue Tec Diesel \n19,000 miles\nClean Title in hand\nArctic White with Tunja Black Upholstery\nBack Up Camera\nBlue Tooth Stereo and phone connect\nPower Windows\nPower Locks\nTrailer Hitch\nRoof rails with tie downs\n\nThanks for looking!\nTory","pid":"6559345582","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/phx/cto/6559345582","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"phoenix.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/phx/cto/6559345582"},"title":"Mercedes Sprinter Camper Van","url":"https://phoenix.craigslist.org/wvl/cto/d/mercedes-sprinter-camper-van/6559345582.html","postedAt":{"$$date":1523564692000},"updatedAt":{"$$date":1524164462000},"images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_iZBKEDUPoDG_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01212_2jclUH8QL2S_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_fmf3MtucaL3_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01515_jtYv2hYIJHw_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_if2YwaExmso_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_3nVKLQt346q_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_dT42ijlcsDG_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_8BvHYU4ZnGP_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_hqWx6L8zY3z_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01414_d5OjLQ74P9O_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{"condition":"like new","cylinders":"6 cylinders","drive":"rwd","fuel":"diesel","odometer":"19000","paint_color":"white","title_status":"clean","transmission":"automatic","type":"van"}}}

(Not Crew, Not Cargo). It has separate front and rear air conditioning units, power windows, power locks, cruise control, back up camera, Pioneer touchscreen AV system with Bluetooth\n\nAftermarket accessories: Viper alarm, roof rack, ladder and brush guard.  Last year I upgraded all shocks.\n\nWear and Tear:  Exterior has faded trim in some places.  Stone chips.  One or two chips on window.  Scratch high on rear from rubbing basketball hoop :( Normal wear and tear on interior.  Items that exceed that are dent to rear fender in front of tire that was banged out, some holes on roof liner, a water stain near A/C (previous owner had warranty replacement of gasket) there but didn't replace headliner.\n\nI purchased this van in May-2016 to solve hauling kids, dog and gear on weekends.  I've only put on 13,000 miles.  I believe I am 3rd owner.  I use this for weekend trips up to my hunting property.  It rides great on highways and cruises 80 mph all day.  These sprinters are factory speed limited at 85mph. The seats are easily removed by 2 people (a bit heavy) and many configurations possible.  I've had 4-wheelers, motor bikes, dogs, bicycles and all in there at different times and lots of leftover space for 2 kids and dog.  Selling as I've upgraded to a new Sprinter 4x4 version.\n\nVan has service records since owner before me.  He had \"B\" maintenance at the dealership at about 126,000 miles.  It has run flawlessly for me and not had a problem with powertrain.  Title in hand. Selling the vehicle AS-IS WITHOUT WARRANTY and accept cash or certified bank checks.  I do not need help selling. I prefer text/email.  I'll check 2x a day to answer questions/concerns.","mapUrl":"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@33.926700,-84.333400,16z","pid":"6561161212","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/atl/cto/6561161212","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"atlanta.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/atl/cto/6561161212"},"title":"2011 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 3.0L V6 Turbo Diesel","url":"https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/d/2011-mercedes-benz-sprinterl/6561161212.html","postedAt":{"$$date":1523732676000},"updatedAt":{"$$date":1523745711000},"images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00909_fgTAb9ok1Kf_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_eEvXdJugZa0_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_kyfWtIEnH7q_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00909_9XLYaKC0TAK_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_gwLMxORNGUi_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_gjM86YPQQ8a_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00707_joChzfAtwbR_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_fAetCpJxXZK_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_lKJVToC538K_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_3UFaS1g1rRW_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01616_iwRwQ9q6Qpa_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00000_9xHRvqLEHxZ_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_83yghDnqUSa_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_iYeFsu4MgiU_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{"condition":"good","cylinders":"6 cylinders","drive":"rwd","fuel":"diesel","odometer":"139000","paint_color":"black","size":"full-size","title_status":"clean","transmission":"automatic"}}}

The staff at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South is committed to serving you, our friends and customers and we look forward to earning your business. For this reason, when dealing with Rick's Auto Marketing Center South you can be assured that your experience will be pressure free and that your satisfaction will be guaranteed.\n\nAutomotive Experience\nRichard Yow, of Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, opened his flagship dealership approximately 27 years ago in Carthage, North Carolina. Since this time, Richard has expanded his business nationwide by having a transparent business structure which has effectively built and continues to build customer loyalty. Proof of continued business excellence is evidenced by his flawless record with the Better Business Bureau, his reputation in the industry for ethical leadership and statewide recognition as a small business leader (as seen in North Carolina Small Business of the Year). Following present day operations at the North Carolina dealership, Richard vows to utilize the same practices and procedures at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South.\n\nWhat Do We Sell?\nThe automobiles being offered for sale at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South are prior corporate fleet lease automobiles and not prior rental or auction units.\n\nHow do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South?\nAs a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups. Furthermore, most of the off-lease automobiles offered for sale have only been assigned to and driven by one driver / owner before arriving on our lot.\n\nWhat Sets Us Apart From the Others?\nFrom the moment you walk in the door, our friendly and relaxed staff will lead you through the buying process without the high pressure you find at other dealerships. At Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, we believe in clear no haggle pricing and aren't afraid to clearly list the purchase price on each automobile.\n\nWe are ready to serve you. Feel free to contact us with any comments or questions you may have.\n\n\n\nRick's Auto Marketing Center South\n1207 N Dixie Freeway \nNew Smyrna Beach, FL 32168\n\n\n\n\n\nCall NOW to Reserve this Ford_ Transit Cargo Van_! 386-259-3415\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Ford* *Transit Cargo Van* *T-250 130\" Low Rf 9000 GVWR Swing-Out RH Dr* **CARGO VAN*WORK VAN*BULKHEAD*CLEAN CARFAX*ONE OWNER** *Ford* *Transit Cargo Van* *T-250 130\" Low Rf 9000 GVWR Swing-Out RH Dr* *For Sale* *Clean* *Oxford White* *Ford* *Transit Cargo Van* *T-250 130\" Low Rf 9000 GVWR Swing-Out RH Dr* *Cheap* *Like New* *Rear Wheel Drive* *3.7L V6 CYLINDER* *Used* *Ford* *Transit Cargo Van* *T-250 130\" Low Rf 9000 GVWR Swing-Out RH Dr* *Ford* *Transit Cargo Van* *T-250 130\" Low Rf 9000 GVWR Swing-Out RH Dr* *Ford* *Transit Cargo Van* *T-250 130\" Low Rf 9000 GVWR Swing-Out RH Dr*","mapUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%31%32%30%37+N+Dixie+Freeway+New+Smyrna+Beach+FL+US","pid":"6550623989","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/lcq/ctd/6550623989","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"lakecity.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/lcq/ctd/6550623989"},"title":"2016 Ford Transit T-250 Low Roof Swing-Out RH Dr Commercial Cargo Van","url":"https://lakecity.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2016-ford-transit-250-low/6550623989.html","postedAt":{"$$date":1522768998000},"images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_ihFbFZXZqip_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00202_cOEV96UVpw2_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_2Honb5UhAML_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_cg4U7O0Wm30_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_fN8ZQru7sHK_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01010_cdyil5zuARN_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_gSTMus1ftR0_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00707_L4mkUNqY6c_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_kfG6hupyD4a_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_2W1pPzRiQXh_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_8TO3QugioLm_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_gAZtoYE4soe_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_5z5vdrZSekP_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_e1ZBmxIkaAi_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_aiRAdRDSCBa_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_dWKAnEyIEAG_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_j6ZidXEPuBt_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_dhCYiQtaPmu_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_iS14YktQCh9_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_tFggeS6rC0_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_7pJ98UK77Rs_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_8KGzUl8B9mB_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00505_6c6UlFeIK9D_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_e6TThB1Rqyi_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{"VIN":"1FTYR1ZM3GKB20457","cylinders":"6 cylinders","drive":"rwd","odometer":"17608","paint_color":"white","title_status":"clean","transmission":"automatic","type":"van"}}}
